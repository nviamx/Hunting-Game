### Screen 1: Character Selection
Players choose their main character from at least two options. Each option is represented by a button with images of the characters. When clicked, Screen 2 is initiated, sending the chosen character as a start value.

### Screen 4: Advanced Gameplay
Similar to Screen 2 but harder, featuring two objects that decrement the score and one that increments the score. After 20 seconds, if the score is 10 or higher, it transitions to Screen 3 with a start value of "end"; otherwise, it transitions with a start value of "repeat."
